## 📘 About the Datathon

The **Datathon for Data-Driven Policy Innovation 2025** is a national-level challenge that empowers students and researchers to harness **data science and machine learning** for **evidence-based policymaking**.  

Hosted on **Unstop**, this event brings together participants from across India to analyze real-world public datasets — primarily from the **education sector** — and uncover actionable insights that can guide data-driven governance.

---

## 🎯 Objectives of the Datathon

- 📊 Use **data analytics and AI models** to explore key challenges in education policy.  
- 🧩 Uncover hidden trends and relationships within **UDISE+ datasets** and other public data sources.  
- 💡 Develop **data-driven policy recommendations** that can directly improve learning outcomes, infrastructure, and retention.  
- 🌍 Promote open data culture and enhance capacity for **evidence-based decision-making** in the public sector.  

---

## 🧩 Dataset & Theme

The core dataset used is the **Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE+)** for academic years **2023–24** and **2024–25**.  
It contains comprehensive school-level data across India, including:

- 📘 **Enrolment, retention, and dropout statistics**  
- 🏫 **School infrastructure & facilities** (toilets, classrooms, labs, electricity, internet, accessibility)  
- 👩‍🏫 **Teacher and student demographics**  
- 🌐 **Digital and environmental readiness indicators**
- **Dataset** [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16KdRFXuCOcHhuj79PT6wYaNeAuYUpVjA)  

The data is massive (millions of rows) and offers a rich foundation for **exploratory, statistical, and predictive modeling**.

## 🧠 My Role in the Datathon

As a participant, I am working on **multiple data analysis prompts** derived from the competition’s objectives — including but not limited to:

- Relationship between **school infrastructure** and **student outcomes** (enrolment, dropout, retention).  
- Correlation between **digital facilities** and **educational participation**.  
- Identifying **high-risk schools** based on composite infrastructure indices.
- Visualizing and Analyzing relationship between child nutrition or health indicators (e.g., anemia) and school attendance 
- Building interpretable **ML models** to support evidence-based interventions.

## ⚙️ Methodology Overview

1. **Data Cleaning & Integration** – Combined UDISE+ 2023–24 and 2024–25 datasets at the school level.  
2. **Feature Engineering** – Derived sub-indices for Physical, Sanitation, Electricity, Accessibility, and Safety infrastructure.  
3. **Normalization & Outlier Handling** – Standardized metrics to ensure comparability across schools.  
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Examined relationships between infrastructure quality and education outcomes.  
5. **Machine Learning Models** – Regression and ensemble techniques (OLS, Random Forest) with SHAP explainability.  
6. **Insight Generation** – Translated findings into actionable insights for potential policy use.
